## Dataset Information

This project uses high-resolution aerial imagery and corresponding
road network ground truth masks for supervised semantic segmentation.

### Data Source
- Public aerial imagery datasets (e.g., SpaceNet, OpenStreetMap-derived labels)
- Data is not included due to size and licensing restrictions

### Data Description
- Input: RGB aerial images
- Output: Binary road masks
- Task: Road network extraction using deep learning

### Preprocessing
- Image tiling
- Normalization
- Mask alignment
- Train-validation-test split

This repository focuses on modeling, evaluation, and GIS interpretation
rather than raw data distribution.
